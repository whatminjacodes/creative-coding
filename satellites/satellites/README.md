# Satellites
An art project using satellite data

### Before you clone
1. Download OpenFrameworks and setup it
2. Satellite data can be gotten from https://www.space-track.org
3. Use for example Python script to converts the satellite data from TLE format to EFEC (from which you can basically get x, y and z coordinates)
- One Python library that can do this is https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/
