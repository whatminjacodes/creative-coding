# Satellites
An art project using satellite data

### Before you clone
1. Download OpenFrameworks and setup it
2. Satellite data can be gotten from https://www.space-track.org
3. Use for example Python script to convert the satellite data from TLE format to x, y and z coordinates
    1. One Python library that can do this is https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/
    2. Example of how I did the conversion can be found from python/skyfield-satellite-positions-converter.py
